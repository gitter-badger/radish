Feature: Compute factorial
    In order to play with Lettuce
    As beginners
    We'll implement factorial

    Scenario: Factorial of 0
        Given I have the number 0
        Given I have the number -1
        When I compute its factorial
        Then I see the number 1
        Then I see the number 1
        Then I see the number 1
        Then I see the number 1
        Then I see the number 1
        Then I see the number 1
        Then I see the number 1
        Then I see the number 1
        Then I see the number 1

    Scenario: Factorial of 0
        Given I have the number 0
        When I compute its factorial
        Then I see the number 1
